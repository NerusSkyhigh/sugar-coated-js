# Sugar-coated Javascript learning journey

I don't like javascript. Despite that, I have to admit that it is a widely used language and it's time for me to learn it. Luckily I found a youtube channel that teaches physics simulations using js. Let's see if this is enough to sugar-coat my js journey.

The channel that I'll use for most of the project is the following: [Ten Minute Physics](https://www.youtube.com/@TenMinutePhysics)
